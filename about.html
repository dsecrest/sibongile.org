          <h1>About Sibongile</h1>

          <p>
            Sibongile Day &amp; Night Care Centre is a registered non-profit and
            public beneficiary organization (041-341-NPO and PBO 930 027 189)
            that aims at providing quality and loving physical, emotional and
            spiritual care to children with cerebral palsy (CP) and other severe
            disabilities in the community of Khayelitsha, Cape Town. Sibongile
            is based on Biblical Christian values.
          </p>

          <h2>The History</h2>
          <p>
            In January 2005, founder Nomasango Xabanisa began to take children
            with cerebral palsy (CP) into her home because she saw a great need
            for specialised care in her community and because her own daughter,
            Sibongile, was disabled due to CP. She realized that there was no
            organisation in the area that took care of these special children
            and - after receiving training at the Red Cross Children’s Hospital
            in Cape Town – registered Sibongile Day &amp; Night Care Centre as a
            non-profit organisation in June 2005.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, in September 2005, Sibongile received two remodelled
            shipping containers as a donation from
            <a href="http://www.breadlineafrica.org" title="Breadline Africa"
              >Breadline Africa</a
            >
            into which the children from Nomasango’s home (and very soon even
            more children from Khayelitsha) moved. Sadly, her daughter Sibongile
            passed away just a few months later leaving Nomasango with the
            courage to keep caring for other disabled children and giving the
            centre her beautiful name (which means “thank you” in isiXhosa).
          </p>

          <p>
            Even though the containers provided the first step to formal care,
            there was neither any electricity, running water, space nor money
            for food, clothing and diapers. Having grown to 12 children by 2006
            it became clear that a proper brick house and sufficient support was
            needed. More and more people became aware of Sibongile and the first
            international donations started coming and sustaining the basic
            needs of the children by the end of that year.
          </p>

          <p>
            In May 2007,
            <a href="http://www.homefromhome.org.za">Home from Home</a> made the
            offer to build a house for Sibongile and after a lot of prayer,
            searching and hoping, the construction of Sibongile 2 commenced in
            June 2008. Meanwhile, the container site (Sibongile 1) was crammed
            with 19 children. The situation was only relieved when Sibongile’s
            miracle house was completed in August 2008 and 12 of the children
            moved into the new house. In December 2009 the remaining children
            from the container moved into a second beautiful house, Sibongile 3,
            that has also been donated by Home from Home.
          </p>

          <p>
            The family continued to grow and August 2010 we received two
            8-seater vehicles sponsored by Ein Herz fur Kinder (Germany).
            Meanwhile the original container site was used for office and
            storage space until Sibongile started it&#8217;s day care program in
            February 2011. With the arrival of six new children, placed with us
            by social services Sibongile began renting and later purchased our
            third residential house; Sibongile 4.
          </p>

          <p>
            With more staff and volunteers coming on board bringing a range of
            expertise and skills, Sibongile had a year of breakthroughs in 2012.
            Our first child was given a placement to formal schooling as well as
            the Department of Social Development coming on board to support us
            with government funding. In March of 2012 there was the grand
            opening of the fully transformed and renovated container site that
            now operates as the Day Care Centre.
          </p>

          <h2>Staff</h2>
          <p>
            Starting off with only three staff Sibongile now in 2013 employs 25
            women from the local community; 22 as care-givers and 3 day care
            teachers. The management team consists of the director, who is
            supported by three house supervisors as well as the
            administrator/finance officer, a volunteer physiotherapist and part
            time public relations/admin assistant. We also have two drivers and
            the board of governors headed up by the chairman.
          </p>

          <p>
            The staff members of Sibongile are all people from the local
            community who have a great heart for the children. Their daily
            responsibilities range from tending to the physical and medical
            needs of the children (bathing, feeding, diaper changing, basic
            physiotherapy, attending hospital appointments and clinics) to
            maintaining the facilities (washing, cleaning, cooking, shopping,
            driving).
          </p>

          <p>
            The day care centre operates Monday-Friday from 7.30am-4pm and the 3
            residential houses run 24 hours per day, 7 days a week with mama’s
            working on a shift basis.
          </p>

          <h2>The Future</h2>
          <p>
            Sibongile has grown rapidly in the first 7 years and we believe that
            as we come out of this pioneering phase there is still a great
            future and many exciting challenges ahead.
          </p>

          <p>
            First of all, it is our aim to develop and implement excellent
            individualized programs extending the current physiotherapy
            programs, and to include occupational and speech therapy programs to
            ensure that each child reaches its full potential both physically
            and mentally. Continued positive working relationships with Red
            Cross Hospital and local clinics, as well as therapeutic advice and
            input from specialized organisations such as
            <a href="http://www.senecio.org.za" title="Senecio">Senecio</a> are
            our main objectives in that area.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our long-term objective for 2016 is to build on the quality and
            professionalism of the care and education for our children. This
            will involve ongoing internal training and professional development
            for the staff as well as opportunities for more parent/family
            involvement and community outreach events such as parent support
            groups, and disability awareness workshops.
          </p>

          <p>
            Khayelitsha is a large township community situated in the Cape Flats
            area of the Western Province of South Africa, the district continues
            to expand and develop and is located 20 minutes from the heart of
            Cape Town CBD. The Xhosa people who are part of the Sibongile family
            are always welcoming and friendly. They bring joy, singing and a
            mother&#8217;s heart to our children and visitors alike. It is
            evident to see at Sibongile that the people embrace their vibrant
            culture despite the often high crime and unemployment rates as well
            as many other socio-economic challenges that affect the community in
            which they live.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            Sibongile currently consists of one day care centre in Phakamisa,
            Khayelitsha and three 3-bedroom houses in Ilitha Park, Khayelitsha.
            The day care centre provides care and a basic education/therapy
            programme for up to 20 children. This includes some residential
            children from Sibongile as well as children from the community, who
            live with parents or family. The three residential locations house
            37 children.
